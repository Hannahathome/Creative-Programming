    - Pressing the following keys on the keyboard: 'a','s','d','f','g','h','j','k','l',';' (controlling the white keys)
    - Pressing the following keys on the keyboard: 'w','e','t','y','u','o','p',         (controlling the black keys)

Text with the video: 
    This project was created because of the idea that music can stimulate more than one sense. This is why I tried to make sound visible. I did this by using a sound system, a laser, wrapping foil and a shard of glass. This entire video explains how the setup exactly works and shows you the result of my idea and program.
